# ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Fundamentals 

![CI](https://github.com/rfalanga/AspNetCore6WebAPIFundamentals/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Fully functioning sample code for my ASP.NET Core 6 Web API Fundamentals course at Pluralsight.  

Tackles fundamental concerns like CRUD, dependency injection, connecting to a database, authentication, versioning & documenting your API, and much more. 

## Addendum 1/26/2023
It's been a year since I looked at this course. I've forgotten what's going on, as my code isn't like the instructor's code. I think
I've forgotten something.
